10) Simplified Startup
11) In Clients, tokenClient, set RequireConsent = false - simplifies demo because data not persisted with in-memory client
12) Commit named "Simplified Startup" mis-named - contains initial implementation.

13) Set RefreshTokenUsage = TokenUsage.ReUse in client definition
14) Added new scope authTestAPI
15) Added conditional code to set up for either a Reference Token or a Jwt to be used by the client app
	(currently set to compile for Reference Token)
